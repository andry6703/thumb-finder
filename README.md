# thumb-finder
**Hey!** This is a very old fork of normanlol/thumb-finder, before Norman decided to delete his GitHub account. Everything here is completely unmodified except this README, but I definitely recommend using his [fixed and improved version of this online tool](https://munkaylol.github.io/thumbnail-finder-revived/). This repository will only be up for archival purposes.

A super simple web app that can find archived YouTube thumbnails almost instantly using [The Internet Archive's Availability API](https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php) and extremely simple JavaScript to run the page.

No attribution is needed if you find what you're looking for or use this code in your own project.
